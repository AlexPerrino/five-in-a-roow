# five-in-a-row
Five in a row game in which the player must beat an overly defensive AI opponent.

Players take turns placing either an X or O stone onto a 9x9 board, aiming to make a row that is at least 5stones long either 
vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Once a stone is placed it cannot be moved or removed, and if all spaces are in use 
and there is no winner it is declared a tie.

AI could be improved upon by attempting to win when it is unable to block the player.
